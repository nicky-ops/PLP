# File I/O, Debugging and Testing
* In Python, we take input from the user using the input() function and print the output to the user using the print() function.
* On the other hand, input refers to the process of taking data from the user and storing it in a program for further processing using the input fucntion.
* The input function returns the user input as a string.
* OUtput is the process of displaying the result of a computation or a processing step to the user, and it is accomplished using the print function.
* You can also handle input/output in other ways such as reading and writing to files using command line arguments or third party libraries.
* Input and Output makes the system interactive
