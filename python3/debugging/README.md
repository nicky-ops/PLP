# Debugging in Python
* *Debugging* in Software Engineering is the process of identifying and removing errors in computer software.

## Techniques of Debugging
### 1. Print statements
One of the simplest and most common debugging techniques is to insert print statements in your code. You can use print statements to check the values of variables, to trace the flow of the program, or to check the output of a function.

### 2. Debugging With Pdb
* *Pdb* - Python's interactive source code debugger.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* *Test-driven develpment* is a software development practice where develpers write test before writing the actual code. The test specify the desired behaviour of the code and serveas a specification for what the code should do.
