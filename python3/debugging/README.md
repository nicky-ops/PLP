# Debugging in Python
* *Debugging* in Software Engineering is the process of identifying and removing errors in computer software.

## Techniques of Debugging
### 1. Print statements
One of the simplest and most common debugging techniques is to insert print statements in your code. You can use print statements to check the values of variables, to trace the flow of the program, or to check the output of a function.

### 2. Debugging With Pdb
